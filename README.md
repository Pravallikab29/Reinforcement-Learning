In this course CAP : 6629 Reinforcement Learning, worked on three projects. Q-learning algorithm is used to learn the agent to reach the goal state in the grid world maze environment. Q-learning Neural network is used to get the optimal policy. Actor critic algorithm is another method used to train the agent to reach the goal by policy evalaution and value function optimization.
